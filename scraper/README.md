# scraper

This is a spike directly searching the [GitHub Archive](https://www.githubarchive.org/) for open-source contributions made by members of a given organisation.

## Setup
You'll need a .lein-env file with credentials for the GitHub API.
Copy .lein-env.example to .lein-env and fill in the blanks.

### GitHub
Create a new [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `read:org` permission.

## Run

This is currently a command-line application.
You can run it with

```console
$ lein run organisation time-period
```

The `time-period` corresponds to a filename of an hourly dump in the GitHub Archive, for example `2017-01-23-15`.

### Example

To fetch contributions from Badgers for 23 January between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC,

```console
$ lein run redbadger 2017-01-23-15
